# MAGD
This is to show projects from MAGD and explain what each one is.

For the Glitch Project, I used a library from P5.Js's website that can turn any image I want into a glitchy yet still identifiable mess. I really enjoyed this assignment because it added a really interesting creepiness factor to it and I love working with Horror. Inside the project I took an image of Stephen King's more infamous character Pennywise and use the glitch library to make the image glitch out, adding an unsettleness factor to the project.

Lab Assignment 6 is a project that I had made on accident when trying to animate a triangle. Instead I created what looked to be the sun raining its beams of lights into the ground, it was really a surprise when I accidently stumbled upon this and is probably one of my favorite works.

Lab Assignment 5 was a project that made me experiment with keyboard and mouse inputs with my code. Based on what you click on, whether it be a key or mouse button the button will change colors. Its pretty simple but it taught me how to control different inputs at the same time.
